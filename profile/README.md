  ## 👋 Welcome to Stoolap

  We're on a mission to revolutionize how developers work with data. **Stoolap** is a high-performance SQL database that seamlessly handles both transactional (OLTP) and
  analytical (OLAP) workloads in a single, pure Go implementation.

  ### 🎯 Our Vision

  Traditional databases force you to choose: fast transactions OR powerful analytics. We believe you shouldn't have to compromise. Stoolap delivers both, eliminating the need
  for complex ETL pipelines, data duplication, and multiple database systems.

  ## 💡 Perfect For

  - **Real-time Analytics** - Dashboards on live data
  - **Embedded Databases** - No external dependencies
  - **Edge Computing** - Lightweight and portable
  - **Microservices** - Single database for all needs
  - **IoT Applications** - Collect and analyze in one place

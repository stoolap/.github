  ## 👋 Welcome to Stoolap

  We're on a mission to revolutionize how developers work with data. **Stoolap** is a high-performance SQL database that seamlessly handles both transactional (OLTP) and
  analytical (OLAP) workloads in a single, pure Go implementation.

  ### 🎯 Our Vision

  Traditional databases force you to choose: fast transactions OR powerful analytics. We believe you shouldn't have to compromise. Stoolap delivers both, eliminating the need
  for complex ETL pipelines, data duplication, and multiple database systems.

  - **Real-time insights** on live transactional data

  ### **Blazing Performance**
  - **Vectorized execution** with SIMD acceleration
  - **2-10x faster** analytical queries
  - **Memory-first design** with optional persistence
